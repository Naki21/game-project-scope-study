After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:
```md
-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
  - I assume this is talking about the data structure I will use in the games win/lose/draw logic. I plan on using an array (within the game object) which will determine the winner based on what idex in the array the player is taking up.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
  - The game board will be an represented as an array indexed 0-8 with the first three indices bing row 1 the next three row 2 etc..

-   How you plan to approach this project.
  - I will first make a basic html layout of the front end. I plan on working out all of the sign in/up/out processes first. Once I get that I will move onto game creation and game  play function requirements. Once I have the core complete I will move on to making the game look nice and the bonus.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
  1) I am a new user and I want to sign up to play tic tac toe.
  2) I am an existing user and I want to sign in to play tic tac toe
  3) I am a signed in user and I wish to change my password
  4) I am a signed in user and I wish to sign out.
  5) I am a signed in user and I want to know whose turn it is.
  6) I am a competitive user and I want to know my game history.
  7) I am a online user and I wish to play with my friend online.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
  -I will practice seperation of concerns using multiple file locations to seperate my code. (Files for API stuffs, for game locig stuff, for user storage stuff, etc..)
-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
  - If I make it to the creative spin part I will try and add animated CSS to my board tiles and possible wav files if I can figure that one out.
-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
  - Commit early, commit often. I will try and employ branching of features aswell.
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
  - Yes but only if I can finish the core.
